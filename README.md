# measurepnpm

`measurepnpm` is a Zsh function that walks through your project‚Äôs `node_modules/.pnpm` directory, measures the on-disk size of every package (as stored by pnpm), and prints a sorted table of package sizes along with a live progress indicator.

---

## Features

- üîç **Accurate**: Reads actual disk usage from pnpm‚Äôs store
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Uses `find` + `du` in tandem for minimal overhead
- üìä **Pretty**: Live spinner & count, colourized output
- üìà **Human-readable**: Prints sizes in K, M, or G as appropriate
- üéØ **Flexible**:
  - Show only the pnpm store path
  - Point at an arbitrary project / `node_modules` / `.pnpm` directory

---

## Requirements

- **Zsh** (tested on zsh 5.8+)
- **pnpm** (for getting the store path)
- Unix tools: `find`, `du`, `realpath`, `awk`, `sort`

---

## Installation

1. **Copy** `measurepnpm.zsh` into your Zsh functions folder (e.g. `~/.zsh-Functions/`).
2. **Source** it from your `.zshrc`:

   ```zsh
   fpath=(~/.zsh-Functions $fpath)
   autoload -Uz measurepnpm
   ```

3. **Reload** your shell:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

---

## Usage

```bash
measurepnpm [ -h | --help ] [ -s | --store ] [ <path> ]
```

- `-h`, `--help`
  Show help message and exit
- `-s`, `--store`
  Print only your pnpm store path
- `<path>`
  Optional path to a project root, `node_modules` folder, or `.pnpm` dir

---

## Examples

1. **Measure current project**

   ```bash
   cd ~/Projects/my-app
   measurepnpm
   ```

2. **Only show your pnpm store location**

   ```bash
   measurepnpm --store
   # Pnpm store path: /Users/you/Library/pnpm/store/v10
   ```

3. **Point at a nested folder**

   ```bash
   measurepnpm ~/some/other/project
   ```
